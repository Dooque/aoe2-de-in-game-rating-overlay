## Introduction

This is an in game rating overlay which shows on top of the screen the RM 1v1 ELO and RM TG ELO for all players in a multiplayer game.

It currently works only for "Random Map" games.

The 1v1 ELO is shown between *[ ]* and the TG ELO is shown between *( )*.

Also it is possible to minimize the window. Right click on the window and click on "Minimize".

The position of the minimized window is independent of the maximized window, so for example, in between games you can put the minimize window in a position where it does not collide with the game's menu.

## Installation & Configuration

The program requires no installation. Just extract the ZIP file, configure your profile ID, install the font, and run the `aoe2de-mp-ratings.exe` file.

You can install the font by double clicking on the `LiberationMono-Bold.ttf` file, and then press `Install` button. Once installed you can close the Font window.

The only required configuration you need is to write your [AoE2.net](https://aoe2.net) profile ID into the `AOE2NET_PROFILE_ID.txt` file.

Right click and the click on `Exit`.

On the search section enter your Steam profile name. Once you see yourself in the table click on your name:

> NOTE: If you don't appear in the list it is because you haven't play at least 10 ranked games. You need to play 10 ranked games to have an AoE2.net profile ID.
